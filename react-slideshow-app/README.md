Your task is to complete the implementation of `src/components/Slides.js` according to the following requirements:

- The Slides component takes an array of slides as a prop. Each element of this array denotes a single slide and is an object with 2 properties: string title and string text.
- On application launch, the first slide must be rendered.
- Clicking on the "Next" button shows the next slide. This button is disabled when the current slide is the last one.
- Clicking on the "Prev" button shows the previous slide. This button is disabled when the current slide is the first one.
- Clicking on the "Restart" button returns to the first slide. This button is disabled when the current slide is the first one.
- You can assume that the passed slides array contains at least one slide.


Initially, the file is filled with boilerplate code. Note the following:

- The "Restart" button must have `data-testid="button-restart"`.
- The "Prev" button must have `data-testid="button-prev"`.
- The "Next" button must have `data-testid="button-next"`.
- Each slide's title must be rendered as an `<h1>` element with `data-testid="title"`.
- Each slide's text must be rendered as a `<p>` element with `data-testid="text"`.

Please note that the component has the above data-testid attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
